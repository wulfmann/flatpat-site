        <p>Flat Pat is a social experience. A twist on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Stanley">Flat Stanley</a>, Flat Pat aims to travel to as many different places as possible.</p>
        
        <p>Flat Pat is a secret from his likeness.</p>
        
        <p>We are documenting Flat Patâ€™s life throughout the year, and will be presenting this project as a surprise at the end of the year.</p>

          <li>1. Get Flat Pat </li>

        </ul>
